## 🏎️ Why BareJS?

BareJS is designed for developers who need extreme speed. It features an **Object Pooling** system for the `Context` object to eliminate Garbage Collection (GC) spikes and a hybrid routing system that supports both modern `Context` patterns and native `Request/Params` styles.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

You don't need to install anything globally. Just run the following command using Bun:

```bash
bun create barejs my-awesome-app
